This page displays some of my non-mathematical projects. You can view
all of the code I have written on [my Github profile][github]. The
remainder of this page is just a summary of the more visual of the
projects I've done.

# 3D Marble Maze

In the fall of my junior year of high school, I took a Design
Technology class. For my final project, I created a three-dimensional
marble maze using a laser cutter. I wrote a Java library,
available [on Github][mazegen], to generate the maze and output
schematics for the laser cutter. It took about 25 hours for my dad and
I to put it together.

# Layerize

The following fall, I took Design Technology 2. For my final project
in that class, I created a cross-sectional model of the
three-dimensional solid displayed
on [the cover of my Calculus textbook][cover], using the laser cutter.
I wrote a [Clojure] library, available [on Github][layerize], to
generate the schematics.

During my sophomore year in high school, I wrote an iOS app called
Chrono Count, which was previously available for download from the iOS
App Store. The code for this app is now available [on Github][cc], and
you can find more information about the functionality of Chrono Count
[cc-details]. If you want to see the original website for Chrono
Count, its contents are archived on Github [here][cc-website].
