Calculus is one of my favorite areas of math, primarily because it is
both extremely powerful and intuitively understandable. However, many
classes and textbooks ruin the magic of calculus by focusing on
formulas and theorems without explaining why they are true.

Enter *Intuitive Explanations*, a collection of intuitive, graphical,
easy-to-understand explanations of many of the more complex concepts
in calculus. It covers topics such as the formal definitions of limits
and integrals, the product and quotient rules, the fundamental theorem
of calculus, theorems about the convergence of sequences and series,
and the definitions and theorems of vector analysis. The document also
includes links to many other resources helpful for learning calculus
around the Web.

You can read *Intuitive Explanations* [here][] (PDF, ~5 MB, 67 pages).
For more information about how it was created, see the [About] page.
