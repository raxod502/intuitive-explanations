In chronological order:

* [TerraFrame]: My first major project, a clone of [Terraria],
  preserved as an example of how terrible code can be if you don't pay
  attention to its quality.
* [Chrono Count]: iOS app to manage countdowns and countups under
  arbitrarily complex schedules, previously available from the iOS App
  Store.
* [Mazegen]: [Java] application to generate and visualize laser-cutter
  schematics for three-dimensional marble mazes.
* [layerize]: [Clojure] application to generate and visualize
  laser-cutter schematics for a cross-sectional model of a "MÃ¶bius
  solid".
* [smarter-playlist]: [Clojure] application to generate iTunes
  playlists combining variety, cohesiveness, and novelty.
* [Radian]: Elegant but practical configurations for [Emacs], [Zsh],
  [Tmux], [Leiningen], and [Git].
* [el-patch]: [Emacs] package for future-proofing Emacs Lisp
  customizations.
* [straight.el]: The straightforward package manager for [Emacs].

You can find all my projects on [Github].
