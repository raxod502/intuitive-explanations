In chronological order, and counting only the reasonably
feature-complete ones:

* [TerrariaClone]: My first major project, a clone of [Terraria],
  preserved as an example of how terrible code can be if you don't pay
  attention to its quality.
* [Chrono Count]: iOS app to manage countdowns and countups under
  arbitrarily complex schedules, previously available from the iOS App
  Store.
* [MazeGen]: [Java] application to generate and visualize laser-cutter
  schematics for three-dimensional marble mazes.
* [*Calculus: Intuitive Explanations*][cie]: 67 pages of [LaTeX]
  content, from limits to vector analysis, with 35 [Ti*k*Z][tikz]
  figures.
* [layerize]: [Clojure] application to generate and visualize
  laser-cutter schematics for a cross-sectional model of a "MÃ¶bius
  solid".
* [smarter-playlist]: [Clojure] application to generate iTunes
  playlists combining variety, cohesiveness, and novelty.
* [Radian]: Elegant but practical configurations for [Emacs], [Zsh],
  [Tmux], [Leiningen], and [Git].
* [cortex.optimise]: General-purpose library for analyzing,
  visualizing, and comparing [gradient descent] algorithms.
* [lazy-map]: Lazy map implementation for [Clojure].
* [`el-patch`][el-patch]: [Emacs] package for future-proofing Emacs
  Lisp customizations.
* [`straight.el`][straight.el]: Next-generation, purely functional
  package manager for the [Emacs] hacker.
* [`intuitiveexplanations.com`][ie]: Personal website built on [Travis
  CI/CD][travis] using [SCons], [Hugo], [LaTeX], [GIMP] and hosted on
  [Netlify].
* [mla-tex]: [LaTeX][latex] [document class] for typesetting papers to
  [MLA] formatting standards.
* [wdx]: Simpler and more robust alternative to [wd], written in
  Python.
* [Hyperschedule]: Fast and powerful course scheduler for the
  [Claremont Colleges].
* [diary-manager]: Command-line tool and [Emacs] package for managing
  daily (encrypted, version-controlled) diary entries.
* [`prescient.el`][prescient.el]: Simple but effective sorting and
  filtering for [Emacs].
* [Madeline]: Novel approach to directory syncing, used to maintain
  complementary mirroring of two filesystem trees via SSH.
* [Blackout]: Unified replacement for [`diminish.el`][diminish.el],
  [`delight.el`][delight.el], and [`dim.el`][dim.el]; allows hiding or
  customizing major and minor mode lighters in [Emacs].
* [heroku-buildpack-emacs]: [Heroku] buildpack to install [Emacs].
* [GNU ELPA Mirror][gnu-elpa-mirror]: GitHub mirror of the [GNU
  ELPA][gnu-elpa] package repository for use with
  [`straight.el`][straight.el].
