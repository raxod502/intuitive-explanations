In chronological order:

* [TerrariaClone]: My first major project, a clone of [Terraria],
  preserved as an example of how terrible code can be if you don't pay
  attention to its quality.
* [Chrono Count]: iOS app to manage countdowns and countups under
  arbitrarily complex schedules, previously available from the iOS App
  Store.
* [Mazegen]: [Java] application to generate and visualize laser-cutter
  schematics for three-dimensional marble mazes.
* [layerize]: [Clojure] application to generate and visualize
  laser-cutter schematics for a cross-sectional model of a "MÃ¶bius
  solid".
* [smarter-playlist]: [Clojure] application to generate iTunes
  playlists combining variety, cohesiveness, and novelty.
* [Radian]: Elegant but practical configurations for [Emacs], [Zsh],
  [Tmux], [Leiningen], and [Git].
* [cortex.optimise]: General-purpose library for analyzing,
  visualizing, and comparing [gradient descent] algorithms.
* [lazy-map]: Lazy map implementation for [Clojure].
* [el-patch]: [Emacs] package for future-proofing Emacs Lisp
  customizations.
* [straight.el]: Next-generation, purely functional package manager
  for the [Emacs] hacker.
* [mla-tex]: [LaTeX] [document class] for typesetting papers to [MLA]
  formatting standards.
* [wdx]: Simpler and more robust alternative to [wd], written in
  Python.
* [Hyperschedule]: Fast and powerful course scheduler for the
  [Claremont Colleges].
* [diary-manager]: Command-line tool and [Emacs] package for managing
  daily (encrypted, version-controlled) diary entries.
* [prescient.el]: Simple but effective sorting and filtering for [Emacs].
