Hi! My name is Radon Rosborough, and I like to write about math. This
website collects several of the mathematical documents I've written.
They are quite diverse, and have quite different purposes from one
another.

* If you want to get an intuitive understanding of some of the more
  complex concepts in calculus, take a look at [Intuitive
  Explanations]. **I recommend starting here!**

[intuitive explanations]: /posts/calculus-intuitive-explanations

* If you want to review Linear Algebra or Differential Equations,
  check out my [Linear Algebra Summary Sheet][linalg]
  or [Differential Equation Solution Strategies][diffeqs].

[diffeqs]: /posts/differential-equation-solution-strategies

* If you want some fun calculus trivia questions,
  try [these ones][calc bowl] that I came up with.

[calc bowl]: /posts/calculus-bowl-expert-edition

* If you're interested in proofs, I have
  the [existence-uniqueness theorem from Differential Equations][p-l]
  and [some derivations from Statistics][stats].

[p-l]: /posts/picard-lindelof-theorem
[stats]: /posts/probability-distributions-means-and-variances

* I also do things other than math. What, you ask? Find
  out [here][other].

# About the Documents

I typeset all of my documents using [LaTeX], a system for professional
typesetting that is used almost universally by mathematicians,
scientists, and engineers for the creation of mathematical,
scientific, and other documents. LaTeX is extremely full-featured and
supports complex equations, advanced page layout, professional-looking
graphics, bibliographies, and hundreds of other typesetting tasks. It
also has the advantage of producing files which are completely
cross-platform and look the same in any application.

For most of my documents, I use a custom [document class] that wraps
the [amsart] class and provides a title page with an abstract,
copyright notice, and build counter. For [Intuitive Explanations], I
used the article class, and for
my [Calculus Bowl questions][calc bowl], I used the beamer class.

You can download all of the source code and associated files used to
generate the documents on this website [here][source]. If you want to
share it with others, please refer them to this website, which will
always have an up-to-date copy. I would appreciate it if you did not
distribute modified versions of the documents; if you have suggestions
for changes, though, I would love to hear themâ€”simply email me at
[radon.rosborough@gmail.com][email]!

# The Future

Occasionally I may post new documents here. I will also generally
correct any mistakes in the documents already posted as soon as they
come to my attention. I don't keep a version history of any sort, but
if you downloaded a document and want to check if it is the most
recent version, the first page of each document includes a line "Build
#" that uniquely identifies its version.

I am very conscientious about avoiding the creation of dead links, so
if I ever move a page or file, the old URL will redirect to the new
location.
