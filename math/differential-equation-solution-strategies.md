As anyone in a Differential Equations class could tell you, there are
a *lot* of different strategies for solving differential equations. I
found it helpful to organize many of these strategies into a single
document.

This document is intended primarily as a reference guide. It contains
complete proofs of each of the techniques it discusses, and also
covers the relevant definitions and properties relevant to the various
types of differential equations. Topics covered include separable and
exact equations, reduction of order, variation of parameters,
judicious guessing (undetermined coefficients), the method of
Frobenius, Laplace transforms, and higher-order equations.

You can read the document [here][] (PDF, ~400 KB, 35 pages). For more
information about how it was created, see the [About] page.
