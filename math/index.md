I've typeset a number of documents about math. Some of them try to
explain difficult concepts, while others are references guides or were
created just for my own amusement.

* **[Calculus: Intuitive
  Explanations](calculus-intuitive-explanations/)** -- The document I
  am the most proud of. 67 pages of clear explanations of concepts
  that are typically handled poorly in the classroom, including:
  * the formal definitions of limits and integrals;
  * the fundamental theorem of calculus;
  * sequence and series theorems; and
  * vector analysis definitions and theorems.
* **[Differential Equation Solution
  Strategies](differential-equation-solution-strategies/)** -- Summary
  of strategies for solving different types of differential equations,
  with proofs. Good if you've forgotten your differential equations
  class, but note that there are a *lot* more techniques than this (of
  which I am happily oblivious).
* **[Linear Algebra Summary Sheet](linear-algebra-summary-sheet/)** --
  Reference sheet for linear algebra theorems, grouped by topic.
  Helped me review; probably not so helpful for learning.
* **[Calculus Bowl: Expert Edition](calculus-bowl-expert-edition/)**
  -- First-year calculus trivia questions, if you're into that kind of
  thing.
* **[Probability Distributions: Means and
  Variances](probability-distributions-means-and-variances/)** --
  [Exactly what it says on the
  tin](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ExactlyWhatItSaysOnTheTin).
  Some proofs of results commonly useful in probability and
  statistics.
* **[Picard-Lindel√∂f Theorem](picard-lindelof-theorem/)** -- Proof of
  the existence-uniqueness theorem for first-order ordinary
  differential equations. I wrote this back when I thought I was
  supposed to understand everything in my textbooks. Probably
  overcomplicated, because it wasn't a good textbook.
