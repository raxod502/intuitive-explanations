At present, I also maintain accounts on Discord and Telegram for
limited use cases. Please do not rely on messages being delivered to
me on those platforms.

I typically respond to all messages on supported platforms within a
few days, but do not guarantee constant availability. If you aren't
hearing back, please feel free to follow up, unless your message is
about something in the following section.

### Things you should not contact me about

* **Most job offers** (unless you have a good reason)
    * Technology companies, especially startups, tend to increase
      wealth inequality and tend to corrode societal infrastructure.
      Also, they just generally tend to treat people like shit. If I
      work for one, it is because I believe the political and social
      impact of its mission does enough good for people to outweigh
      the harm.
    * Please be prepared to explain why working for your company would
      be an opportunity for me to correct structural inequities,
      dismantle abusive systems, or otherwise produce positive social
      change.
    * Unsolicited job offers from people who have clearly given no
      thought to whether they would be of interest to me will simply
      be reported as spam, since that's what they are.
* **Working at a trading or defense company**
    * Sorry, I'm not convinced either of these sectors have a positive
      impact on the world.
* **Artificial intelligence / generative AI**
    * The vast supermajority of products and companies currently
      marketed as "AI" are various flavors of useless, fraudulent,
      counterproductive, or actively abusive. There are *rare*
      exceptions, and you should be prepared to explain why your use
      case is one of them.
* **Cryptocurrency / NFTs / Web3, Metaverse**
    * See [Line Goes Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g),
      [Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/what),
      [The Future is a Dead
      Mall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZhdpLXZ8Q).
* **Website design consulting / SEO / advertising contracts**
    * If you have a suggestion for my website, you can [send a pull
      request](https://github.com/raxod502/intuitive-explanations).
      Otherwise, please don't bother. My readers are human beings, not
      units of attention to be bought and sold.

Also, [don't use AI to write your email](https://claytonwramsey.com/blog/prompt/).
Even if it's ["just for editing"](https://zanlib.dev/blog/reliable-signals-of-honest-intent/).
