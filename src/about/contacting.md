title: Contacting me
---

The best way to contact me is email:
[radon@intuitiveexplanations.com](mailto:radon@intuitiveexplanations.com)
for personal matters, or
[contact@radian.codes](mailto:contact@radian.codes) for
[business](https://radian.codes). If you already know me and have my
phone number, then Signal or SMS are the preferred contact methods. No
other inbound messaging systems are monitored at this time.

### Things you should not contact me about

* **Anything related to cryptocurrency, NFTs, Web3, or the Metaverse**
    * See [Line Goes Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g),
      [Web3 is Going Just Great](https://web3isgoinggreat.com/what),
      and [The Future is a Dead
      Mall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiZhdpLXZ8Q) for reasons
      why I don't associate with these technologies.
* **Working at a trading or defense company**
    * Sorry, I'm not convinced either of these sectors have a positive
      impact on the world.
* **Job offers that don't have something special to recommend them**
    * I'm quite happy with my current job! It has great work/life
      balance, I have lots of impact and ownership, am learning a lot,
      and work on things that interest me. If you want to recruit me,
      you need to have a good reason why working at your company would
      be even better. Higher salary does not count, I make enough
      money already to afford the things I need.
    * Great matches for my interests: infrastructure, DevOps,
      containerization, open source, application deployment,
      networking, databases, programming languages, reverse
      engineering, compilers, server administration, package
      management (see [my projects list](/about/projects) for a sense
      of what I tend to work on)
    * Poor matches for my interests: frontend, machine learning,
      product design, web development
        * I can and have done all of these things, but I don't enjoy
          them as much
* **Website design consulting / SEO / advertising contracts**
    * If you have a suggestion, you can [send a pull
      request](https://github.com/raxod502/intuitive-explanations).
      Otherwise, please don't bother. I don't run ads and I'm not
      interested in scams.
