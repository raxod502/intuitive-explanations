title: About Me
---
Hi, my name is Radon Rosborough (they/them). You may know me as
**@raxod502** online due to a juvenile teenage username choice that is
now a load-bearing component of some critical open-source
infrastructure and therefore can never be changed.

I live in San Francisco, CA.

## Professional work

Since 2020, I have worked full-time professionally as a software,
infrastructure, and networking engineer. This includes things like:

* Container orchestration and service deployment frameworks
* Zero-downtime maintenance and replacement of legacy systems
* Internal tooling, system documentation, and automation
* Low-level operating system and network debugging
* System monitoring, automated alerting, and incident response
* API reverse engineering and security hardening
* Open-source project development, contribution, and community
  management

If you would like to recruit me, please read [contacting
me](contacting), which lists several sectors I refuse to work in.
Unsolicited job offers for those areas will be reported as spam.

### Skills

In interviewing over 70 candidates for engineering positions, I have
learned that a resume tells you almost nothing about whether someone
has any relevant technical skills. Instead of a resume, I offer
examples of my publicly available work and writing for your
evaluation. It is my hope that this will be more convincing than a
resume to the kind of people with whom I prefer to work.

* Understanding the nuances of computer networking; documenting and
  communicating about issues in an organized way:

    * <https://station.railway.com/questions/station-railway-com-drops-tls-client-hell-64306b87>
* Doing reliable system administration in a production environment,
  and improving the maintainability and documentation of operational
  procedures for systems I work with over time:
    * <https://wiki.dominionstrategy.com/index.php/Ubuntu_upgrade_2023-11-15>
* Designing novel technical solutions to problems, and keeping them
  reliably maintainable as they change over many years:

### Past experience

From 2020 to 2025, I worked at [Plaid](https://plaid.com/) on the
Infrastructure team of about ten engineers. Though the specifics of
ownership changed over time, Infrastructure was responsible for around
seventy different services in all, including Plaid's Kubernetes
clusters, microservice framework, deployment systems, continuous
integration, network topology and service mesh architecture, package
management, PKI, infrastructure-as-code, cost management, databases,
logging, disaster recovery, metrics aggregation, alerting pipelines,
tracing, on-call tooling, and many other individual components.
Although I worked on everything the team owned at one time or another,
my focus (by choice) tended to be on improving operational maturity:
for example, making pager alerts more actionable and less frequent;
transforming ad-hoc procedures by individuals into documented steps
that can be used and improved by anyone on the team; and correcting
structural issues such as nebulous ownership boundaries which tend to
create technical debt over time.

For ethical reasons, I changed jobs in 2025 to instead work as an
infrastructure and reverse engineer at [Beeper](https://beeper.com/).
Large tech companies like Apple, Meta, and Google perpetuate horrific
abuses to people and society, and I feel it's important to reduce the
de-facto monopoly power they exercise at the expense of consumer
rights and human decency. Given that the network effects of closed
chat networks are one very effective way that these companies maintain
their power, I feel that my work at Beeper to make those networks
interoperable by means of open-source [Matrix](https://matrix.org/)
bridges (that people can run themselves if they wish) is a specific
way I can contribute to positive social change and that I can give
people more power against the corporations that want to abuse them.

## Personal background

I grew up in Boulder, CO, went to college for computer science at
[Harvey Mudd College](https://www.hmc.edu/) in Claremont, CA, and
subsequently settled in the San Francisco Bay Area where I intend to
stay for the foreseeable future.

I am queer, transgender, and non-binary, and use [they/them
pronouns](https://www.verywellmind.com/they-them-pronouns-7110726). I
am also on the autism spectrum, and experience [anxiety and
depression](https://intuitiveexplanations.com/mental-health/students-speak)
as well as chronic pain. Finally, I am white, economically well-off,
and a US citizen. These aspects of my identity and experience, as well
as what I have learned from the people around me, have informed my
worldview, which is socially and politically progressive.

### Values and politics

While every person's value system is too complex and multidimensional
to fully capture in writing, I nevertheless offer here a few specific
examples of beliefs that I hold on contested topics.

**Most contemporary software design principles are catastrophically
anti-human.** The majority of consumer software (webapps, mobile apps,
smart devices) is terribly designed, and paradoxically high-budget
companies like Apple, Facebook, and Google often use those resources
in ways that make their products worse rather than better. There is a
bizarrely celebrated trend towards infantilization in consumer
software design, where it's taken for granted that complexity is
irreducible and impossible to manage, and therefore the only way to
produce a superior user experience is to remove features, stop people
from making their own decisions, and raze everything that strays off a
single golden user story. I believe in technology that teaches people
implicit skills as they use it, and empowers them to understand,
control, and achieve more over time. People should use software as a
tool, not the other way around, and the idea that manipulating a
computer is somehow an inaccessible or specialized skill is a lie
peddled by companies with an interest against a skilled and engaged
community.

**Security is best achieved through community solidarity, not
restriction of freedom.** The word "security" as used by both tech
companies and national governments is so broad as to be essentially
meaningless, and justifies wildly inappropriate behavior in both
cases. It is of paramount importance to ask: "security *for* whom?
security *from* whom? and security *to what end?*" Militaristic
solutions rarely produce meaningful security in any useful sense,
especially in the long term. For example, I feel day-to-day safety in
a city where I feel connected to my neighbors and where I know that
everyone has access to the resources they need to survive, not in one
where potential "suspects" of misconduct are constantly being shaken
down by police. In the realm of technology, I feel comfortable in my
digital privacy when I use open-source software packaged by a network
of cooperative volunteers, not when every app I install has to be
personally approved by Big Brother Google. The fact that open-source
software is as or more secure and trustworthy compared to proprietary
software, despite receiving billions of dollars less in funding and
venture capital, is an astonishing indicator of how much better a job
can be done by community-oriented security solutions.

**Efficiency and commerce are not fundamental social goods.** Most
tech companies (and especially startups) are making the world a worse
place. Even setting aside the ones that participate in
straightforwardly evil monopoly practices, abuse of employees, or
support of right-wing extremism, there is a baseline way in which tech
companies tend to exacerbate income inequality and divert resources
from existing communities towards shiny but ultimately ineffective
technologies. As such, an ethical company needs to actively produce
social good. However, even taking this premise for granted, many
people seem to have a lax understanding of social good, and consider
simply "disrupting an outdated industry" or "automating a slow
process" or "making it easier to build things" to be a self-evident
positive good for the world without giving any thought to the actual
concrete impact these structural changes will have on the everyday
people they affect. Introducing technology does not automatically make
people's lives better, especially when the company introducing it is
primarily trying to extract money rather than actually help members of
a specific community that they have an understanding of and personal
relationship with.

**Open-mindedness is not the same thing as gullibility.** It behooves
me to keep an open mind in the sense that the amount of knowledge in
the world greatly exceeds what I can possess at any given time. There
are many parts of the world and of other people's experiences that I
know I have insufficient information to make statements about, and
sometimes my beliefs turn out to be based on wrong or biased
information. However, not every alternative idea should be treated
equal: this is the fallacy of [false
balance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_balance), which has been
weaponized by many contemporary hate groups to give people and
reporters the impression that there is still a legitimate discussion
to be had about their long-since-discredited conspiracy theories. It
is both foolish and intellectually lazy to pretend that claims like
"modern vaccines might be too dangerous to be recommended" and "it
might be too easy for trans children to access gender-affirming care"
are good-faith suggestions that should be discussed in any way other
than to reference the extensive scientific literature that has already
ruled them out as plausible ideas.

**Most contemporary usage of AI is both anti-intellectual and
anti-community.** The underlying technology is not inherently evil.
However, LLMs seem to attract people with bad ideas like flies to
honey, partly because of a very expensive campaign by AI companies to
sell lies about what they are and are not capable of, but also because
the technology is ideal for *appearing* to be more sophisticated than
it actually is, and for creating products that *appear* to work better
than they actually do. While there are certain small, well-defined
tasks that a skilled software engineer can make good use of AI models
for, the general trend to try to write code as fast as possible using
an LLM is completely uncompelling to me. As a software engineer, I do
not simply churn out code. I also engage in an ongoing learning
process about each level of the software stacks I work with, identify
limitations in open-source components that affect my development and
contribute improvements to them, build improved tooling, and use my
work experience to develop creative solutions to improve the software
communities that I am a part of, informed by my actual on-the-ground
experience of configuring, contributing to, documenting, and deploying
the software in those communities. Using AI to skip out on all the
opportunities to learn about how languages and operating systems work
in practice, auto-generating hacky boilerplate code rather than
contributing improvements to frameworks or building better ones, and
generally taking a hyper-individualist approach to software
development that lacks any meaningful community engagement, is just
not something that has any appeal whatsoever to me. The problem here
isn't the technology, it's the mindset. A lot of people were already
approaching programming this way, and I always disapproved; the
availability of generative AI models has just made it a lot easier to
cheap out on giving back to the communities you benefit from.

**Contemporary leftist organizing strategy requires dramatic
improvement before it can construct a practiceable alternative to
neoliberal capitalism.** Have a read through [Inventing the
Future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inventing_the_Future:_Postcapitalism_and_a_World_Without_Work),
or the summary in that Wikipedia page.

## Technology choices

People are often curious: if I eschew Apple and Google, then what do I
use? I've done considerable work to identify alternatives across the
hundreds of proprietary services I previously depended on, and some of
that work might be the subject of future writing. For now, here is a
short list.

### Laptop/desktop

* Laptop: [Framework](https://frame.work/) for the repairability and
  Linux support. The ones with AMD graphics cards, because fuck
  NVIDIA. I also have a [System 76](https://system76.com/) laptop but
  find it less robust.
* Desktop operating system: [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/)
  exclusively due to the greatly superior [packaging
  ecosystem](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/PKGBUILD) and
  [documentation](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Main_page).
  Anything that can be done on another distribution can be ported to
  Arch with minimal effort; the converse is not true.
* Desktop environment: [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) with some
  minimal configurations.
* Filesystem: [BTRFS](https://btrfs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) for
  subvolume and snapshot support, installed in an encrypted
  [LUKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Unified_Key_Setup) volume
  (with `/boot` encryption) accessed by
  [GRUB](https://www.gnu.org/software/grub/).
* Server operating system: either Arch Linux or
  [Ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/), the latter for systems that don't
  require too much upkeep since it's more broadly supported out of the
  box by hosting providers and isn't too inconvenient for simple use
  cases.

### Other devices

* Phone: For now, [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/) compiled from
  source on the [Google Pixel
  6a](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_6a), with
  [KernelSU](https://kernelsu.org/), [LSPosed](https://lsposed.org/),
  and [ReVanced](https://revanced.app/) modification frameworks. Apps
  installed from [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/en/) or [Aurora
  Store](https://auroraoss.com/). Automation using
  [Tasker](https://tasker.joaoapps.com/) and
  [AutoNotification](https://joaoapps.com/autonotification/). Google
  services either
  [sandboxed](https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play) or
  via [microG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroG); push
  notifications via [ntfy](https://ntfy.sh/). Keyboard from
  [FUTO](https://keyboard.futo.org/). In the future,
  [/e/OS](https://e.foundation/e-os/) on the
  [Fairphone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairphone).
* Server hosting: [PikaPods](https://www.pikapods.com/) for
  off-the-shelf open-source applications;
  [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/) for most ad-hoc physical
  servers; [Railway](https://railway.com/) for mostly-idle custom
  applications and some cron jobs (with [Sleeping
  Beauty](https://github.com/radian-software/sleeping-beauty) to
  minimize billing); [Fly.io](https://fly.io/) for anything beefier or
  with durability requirements; Amazon EC2 for my Minecraft server
  hosting, to take advantage of cheap billing for stopped instances,
  but with a project in the works to move that hosting elsewhere.
* Application monitoring: Self-hosted [Uptime
  Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet/) for uptime monitoring,
  [Netdata Cloud](https://www.netdata.cloud/) for server metrics,
  [Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io/) (one of my favorite and
  best-run services) as back-stop and for cron job monitoring, and
  some custom Node.js code in a Railway container to perform more
  advanced checks on specific applications such as SMS deliverability.
* Networking: Router running [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org/) with
  [ip6neigh](https://github.com/AndreBL/ip6neigh); VLAN by
  [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/).
* Personal device tracking: Self-hosted [FMD](https://fmd-foss.org/)
  server.
* Sex toy control: [Buttplug.io](https://buttplug.io/).
* Website analytics: very minimal, via self-hosted
  [Umami](https://umami.is/) instance that collects no tracking
  information but can still be easily blocked by default uBlock Origin
  rules if you wish.

### Software

* Camera: Built-in [GrapheneOS
  Camera](https://github.com/GrapheneOS/Camera), alongside [Atharok
  Barcode
  Scanner](https://atharok.gitlab.io/site/projects/barcode-scanner/),
  [wewewe718 QR & Barcode
  Scanner](https://github.com/wewewe718/QrAndBarcodeScanner), and
  [Fossify Voice
  Recorder](https://github.com/FossifyOrg/Voice-Recorder).
* Digital wallet: None, I have a physical wallet and it works great.
* Document scanning: For documents, [ScanSnap
  iX500](https://www.scansnapit.com/en-gb/products/scansnap-ix500)
  driven by
  [SANE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scanner_Access_Now_Easy). For
  receipts, [Adobe
  Scan](https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/mobile/scanner-app.html)... for
  now.
* Password manager: [Pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/), with
  [Android-Password-Store](https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store)
  and
  [Browserpass](https://github.com/browserpass/browserpass-extension)
  frontends. Extensions
  [pass-otp](https://github.com/tadfisher/pass-otp) and my own
  [pass-ln](https://github.com/radian-software/pass-ln). Browser addon
  [Auto 2FA](https://github.com/FreshSupaSulley/Auto-2FA) to handle
  Duo Mobile without a proprietary app.
* Photo editing: [Krita](https://krita.org/en/) or
  [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/#gsc.tab=0) on desktop,
  [dev.macgyver Photo Editor](https://www.iudesk.com/) on mobile.
* Shell: [Zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) for daily
  systems, [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for automation
  and servers. Configuration from my own
  [Radian](https://github.com/radian-software/radian).
* Terminal emulator: [GNOME
  Terminal](https://help.gnome.org/gnome-terminal/) (not GNOME
  Console) on desktop, [Termux](https://github.com/termux/termux-app)
  on mobile. Multiplexing with [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux).
* Text editor: [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), duh, with
  my own [Radian](https://github.com/radian-software/radian)
  configuration. Or, for more advanced typesetting and document
  preparation, [LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) or
  [LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/).
* Voice and speech to text: [FUTO Voice
  Input](https://voiceinput.futo.org/) and
  [RHVoice](https://rhvoice.org/).
* Web browser: [Firefox](https://www.firefox.com/en-US/), obviously,
  with [uBlock Origin](https://ublockorigin.com/), [Location
  Guard](https://github.com/chatziko/location-guard),
  [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/),
  [Vimium](https://vimium.github.io/), [Indie Wiki
  Buddy](https://getindie.wiki/) (with self-hosted
  [BreezeWiki](https://breezewiki.com/) instance),
  [GhostText](https://ghosttext.fregante.com/).

### Online services

* Backups: On-site backups use BTRFS snapshots generated by
  [Snapper](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Snapper). Off-site
  backups are performed by [Borg](https://www.borgbackup.org/),
  configured by [Borgmatic](https://torsion.org/borgmatic/), and
  stored on [BorgBase](https://www.borgbase.com/). PikaPods backups
  are stored in [Backblaze
  B2](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-storage).
* Document sharing and collaboration: Self-hosted
  [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.com/) server with [Collabora
  Online](https://www.collaboraonline.com/).
* File synchronization: [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) installed
  on my laptops, phone, and a virtual private server for reliability.
* Flight tracking: [Skyscanner](https://www.skyscanner.com/).
* Mail provider: [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com/), unambiguously
  the best for their excellent standards support and contributions to
  [new standards](https://jmap.io/). I also have a self-hosted mail
  relay integrated with my Fastmail account (open-source and write-up
  pending) that filters embedded advertisements out of mail from
  certain senders who stoop to such depths.
    * Contacts and calendar: Both provided by Fastmail. Synchronized
      with mobile using [Davx⁵](https://www.davx5.com/).
* Messaging: [Signal](https://signal.org/), SMS/MMS (with self-hosted
  [Zipline](https://zipline.diced.sh/) and
  [PrivateBin](https://privatebin.info/) servers to include
  high-resolution attachments and disappearing messages), or email.
  Everyone has access to at least one of these if they're reachable
  digitally at all. To synchronize messages across all my devices and
  handle backups, I use self-hosted [Matrix
  bridges](https://matrix.org/ecosystem/bridges/) accessed via
  [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) and
  [Element](https://element.io/en). Specifically:
  [beeper/android-sms](https://gitlab.com/beeper/android-sms),
  [mautrix/signal](https://github.com/mautrix/signal),
  [mautrix/telegram](https://github.com/mautrix/telegram),
  [mautrix/discord](https://github.com/mautrix/discord).
* Navigation: For now, [HERE
  WeGo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Here_WeGo) on both desktop and
  mobile.
* Newsletters: Where possible, via
  [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) using
  [rss2email](https://github.com/rss2email/rss2email) and/or
  self-hosted [RSSHub](https://rsshub.app/) instance. Otherwise by
  email subscription.
* Note-taking and to-do lists: Primarily Emacs [Org
  Mode](https://orgmode.org/) (with agenda, capture, clock), with
  [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) for mobile note-taking and
  [organice](https://organice.200ok.ch/) for mobile access to Org
  files.
* Online forms: [Jotform](https://www.jotform.com/) for now.
* Online videos: For YouTube content, I track subscriptions with a
  self-hosted [Invidious](https://invidious.io/) instance, then
  download desired videos with
  [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) and watch them in
  [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/). In the case of visiting the
  actual YouTube website, [SponsorBlock](https://sponsor.ajay.app/)
  and [Remove YouTube
  Shorts](https://github.com/raven0230/Remove-Youtube-Shorts) are
  mandatory. I also subscribe to [Nebula](https://nebula.tv/) for
  creators available there.
* Photo storage: Self-hosted [PhotoPrism](https://www.photoprism.app/)
  instance. Photos are uploaded from Android by
  [PhotoSync](https://www.photosync-app.com/home), or via self-hosted
  [PhotoPrismProxy](https://github.com/radian-software/photoprismproxy)
  instance.
* Search engine: [Kagi](https://kagi.com/) for the automated removal
  of AI slop and ability to customize search results to further tune
  quality, or [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com/) for untrusted
  systems. [TinEye](https://tineye.com/) for reverse image search.
* Social networks: None, I maintain relationships in real life and via
  direct messaging.
* Translation service: [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/) for now, though
  I am looking at alternatives.
* Videoconferencing and calls: Signal, [Jitsi](https://jitsi.org/), or
  direct phone call.

### Finance

* Financial institutions: [Elevations Credit
  Union](https://www.elevationscu.com/) (personal checking, debit,
  credit, check writing, bill pay) and [SF Fire Credit
  Union](https://sffirecu.org/) (business checking, debit).
* Money transfer: credit union bill pay (ACH via email or SMS),
  physical cash, [Western
  Union](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Union),
  [Wise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wise_(company)), or if
  absolutely necessary Venmo (with [Venmo Auto
  Cashout](https://github.com/evanpurkhiser/venmo-auto-cashout)). To
  ease transfer bookkeeping, [Splitwise](https://www.splitwise.com/)
  (for now).
* Donations: Via [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/) or [Open
  Collective](https://opencollective.com/) where possible, or direct
  via ACH transfer or debit/credit. Some donations are done through
  Patreon or GitHub Sponsors... for now.
* Accounting: Custom tool, to be open-sourced.

### Media/purchases

* Books: Mostly borrowed from one of eleven different California
  libraries, either physically or via
  [Libby](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libby_%28service%29).
  Purchases managed by [Calibre](https://calibre-ebook.com/) and read
  on [Kobo Libra
  H2O](https://us.kobobooks.com/products/kobo-libra-h2o).
* DRM: No statement is made here about my personal interactions with
  DRM, but it can be observed that
  [libgourou](https://forge.soutade.fr/soutade/libgourou/)
  conveniently removes Adobe DRM from ebooks and
  [noDRM/DeDRM\_tools](https://github.com/noDRM/DeDRM_tools) removes a
  number of other DRM formats, including [legacy Kindle
  DRM](https://old.reddit.com/r/Calibre/comments/1iujtfj/final_post_for_those_who_want_to_use_kindle_for/)
  from ebooks. It can also be observed that [The Pirate
  Bay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Pirate_Bay), [Anna's
  Archive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anna%27s_Archive), and
  [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/) can be used in
  combination with a port-forwarding VPN such as
  [AirVPN](https://airvpn.org/) to obtain copies of media that are not
  otherwise available for DRM-free purchase anywhere. I strongly
  recommend making legitimate purchases of media whenever it is
  possible to do so, to reward authors and publishers for selling
  DRM-free.
* Graphic novels and comics: Mostly purchased in hard copy from
  various San Francisco bookstores.
* Music: Purchased exclusively DRM-free, mostly from
  [Bandcamp](https://bandcamp.com/). Music library managed by custom
  software to be released. For now, also some streaming from YouTube
  Music in concert with ReVanced.
* Podcasts: On [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/).
* Shopping: From local brick-and-mortar businesses where possible, and
  otherwise online from wholesale suppliers or other storefronts
  specialized in the relevant area. Groceries, pharmacy, and household
  supplies from neighborhood businesses.
* Video games: Purchased DRM-free from sites like
  [GOG](https://www.gog.com/en/) or [itch.io](https://itch.io/) where
  possible. For Steam games, an open-source client is in the works.
* Webcomics: Tracked via [Mihon](https://mihon.app/) with
  [keiyoushi/extensions](https://github.com/keiyoushi/extensions).
