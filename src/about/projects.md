This page lists some of my personal, work, and school projects. You
can find the source code for (almost) all of these projects and more
on [GitHub].

All of my open-source projects receive continued maintenance when
needed. The dates below, however, show when most of the major
development happened.

## Currently working on

  Extremely fast online playground for every programming language.
* Shallan (Spring -- Summer 2021; not yet published): Personal music
  library player combining the user-friendly interface and
  cross-device synchronization of [YouTube Music][ytm] with the
  flexibility and ownership of a self-hosted open-source solution.
  Attempt #5 at a personal music library manager.

  you to guess the language based on the visual appearance of the
  code.
* TerrariaCloneClone (Winter 2021; not yet published): Rewrite of
  [TerrariaClone] in [C++] on [SFML], an experiment to see how much

  Interactive online Python REPL in 30 lines of JavaScript.
* [Messenger Mirror][mm] (Fall 2021): Small [Python] application using

## Deprecated projects

* [CAS] (Summer 2014): Failed attempt to create a [computer algebra
  system], like [Mathematica].
* [minimal-webapp] (Summer 2016): Noble effort to create a
  [ClojureScript] webapp that did not require a huge number of
  incomprehensible build system configuration files that nobody quite
  understood. It almost worked.
* [mood-tracker] (Spring 2017): Small [AppleScript] utility to record
  data about personal mood at regular intervals. This project was
  abandoned when I realized that trying to systematize everything in
  my life was actually not making me happier.
* [acc] (Summer 2017 -- Summer 2018): Command-line accounting tool
  with first-class support for reconciling multiple ledgers
  interactively. This project was abandoned when it was pointed out to
  me by a friend that I didn't actually have to track every single one
  of my financial transactions.
* [Dotman] (Summer 2017 -- Summer 2018): A very silly idea I had to
  write a unified package manager (with [Ruby] DSL) for my entire
  system configuration (e.g. software installation, configuration,
  dotfiles, misc scripts, etc.). This was abandoned when I realized I
  could just manually write down what I did to configure my laptop. If
  you actually want declarative system configuration, you should
  probably be using [Nix].
* [elint] (Summer -- Fall 2017): An attempt at deduplicating various
  [CI] utilities for my [Emacs] packages. It didn't provide enough
  value to justify the overhead, although there are other projects
  which provide the same functionality in a more powerful manner.
* [etunes] (Fall 2017 -- Summer 2018): [Declarative],
  [version-controlled][version control] music library manager for
  [Emacs]. Attempt #1 at a personal music library manager.
* [Madeline] (Summer 2018): Novel approach to directory syncing, used
  to maintain complementary mirroring of two filesystem trees via SSH.
  This idea, while interesting, never served my use case terribly well
  in the end, and the implementation is terrible. I now use a smaller
  and better-targeted personal script to serve a similar function.
* [fstunes] (Winter 2018): Extremely minimal music library manager
  leveraging [UNIX filesystem] abstractions. Attempt #2 at a personal
  music library manager.
* [µTunes][utunes] (Spring -- Winter 2019): Aggressively minimal
  command-line music player and library manager following the [UNIX
  philosophy], with [Emacs] interface. Attempt #3 at a personal music
  library manager.
* [Pyrelight] (Spring -- Summer 2020): More sophisticated command-line
  music player and library manager. Attempt #4 at a personal music
  library manager.

## Abandoned and on-hiatus projects

* [space-grid] (Spring 2012): An attempt at a clone of the Flash game
  [Star Relic] in [Python]. It didn't get very far, because I didn't
  actually know any game programming.
* [MazeGen Neue] (Summer 2016): An attempt to rewrite [MazeGen] to be
  slightly less of a mess. Unfortunately, I went much too far in the
  opposite direction and created some [Enterprise FizzBuzz], and the
  project was abandoned.
* [dfa] (Spring 2016): A quickly-abandoned attempt to use [Clojure] to
  generate [DFAs] using a [genetic algorithm].
* [pset] (Fall 2017): Configurable templating system for university
  problem sets typeset in LaTeX.
* [Ishikk] (Summer 2018): Read-write [Google Calendar] interface for
  Emacs, with graphical week view.
* [Tabcrush] (Summer 2019): High-performance power tool for editing
  large-scale tabular data in [Emacs], intended for use with µTunes.
* [Mercury] (Summer -- Fall 2019): [Emacs] interface to [Facebook
  Messenger], [Signal], and SMS (via [Google Hangouts][hangouts])
* [Dumbparens] (Spring 2020): Sane delimiter-matching package for
  [Emacs] with primitives based on [syntax tables], replacing
  [Smartparens], [Paredit], and [Electric Pair
  mode][electric-pair-mode].
