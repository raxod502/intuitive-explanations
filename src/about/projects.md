title: Projects
---

This page lists some of my personal, work, and school projects. You
can find the source code for (almost) all of these projects and more
on my [personal GitHub account][github] and the [Radian LLC GitHub
organization][radian-github].

Projects are organized into sections alphabetically by topic and then
chronologically by when the most work was done on them, and may be
tagged:

* `archived`, in case the project was relatively complete, but is no
  longer planned to be updated or actively maintained to keep it
  functioning.
* `abandoned`, in case I gave up on the project before finishing it,
  and never plan to return (e.g. because it was a bad idea).
* `unfinished`, in case the project isn't in a finished state where it
  is a viable product yet, but I plan to get back to it at some point.
* `as employee at XYZ`, in case the project was completed for an
  employer.
* `as student at XYZ`, in case the project was completed in connection
  with a high school or college class.
* `proprietary`, in case the project is not open-source due to
  ownership by a third party such as a former employer.
* `private`, in case the project is not open-source due to security or
  privacy concerns (e.g.: personal information cannot be easily
  separated from source code).

Unless otherwise specified, projects can be assumed to be generally
feature-complete, open-source, and receiving ongoing maintenance when
needed. But, there are a *lot* of unfinished ideas here, because I
believe in sharing my unimpressive work as well: an unfinished project
may still have an interesting idea, or the code already written might
be helpful to a person who wants to build something similar.

Note that most of these projects are owned and operated by [Radian
LLC], who will be the liable party in the case of legal disputes.
[Reach out][contact] if you have a concern. A subset are my personal
work instead. When in doubt, check the license notice in the relevant
GitHub repository. Obviously, work projects are the property and
liability of the relevant employer(s), and the same applies to some
school projects.

I also do a lot of smaller work outside of the below (e.g.
contributions to others' open-source projects, operational work to
replace personal use of proprietary services); what's listed are the
things that fit reasonably enough into the shape of a "project" that
they can be summarized into a list item.

Just in case it is not clear, **nothing** I publish is AI-generated.

  too far in the opposite direction and created some [Enterprise
  FizzBuzz], and the project was abandoned.
* Friend Finder (Summer 2021, private; archived): Physical box with
  colored LEDs showing free/busy status of apartment housemates and
  buttons that could be used to summon free housemates for activities.

* [acc] (Summer 2017 -- Summer 2018; abandoned): Command-line
  accounting tool with first-class support for reconciling multiple
  ledgers interactively. This project was abandoned when it was
  pointed out to me by a friend that I didn't actually have to track

  the by-this-point excessive number of projects I have, generate a
  searchable registry, and create fun statistics and graphs about what
  kind of work I've done over time.
* [Calmerge] (Fall 2025): Utility to merge multiple [CalDAV] calendars
  together and keep them in sync, for example to share a single
  calendar with an external party.
* [FMD Healthcheck] (Spring 2026): Cron job that implements enough of

* [Zelle reverse engineering] (Summer -- Fall 2023): Full client for
  command-line authentication to now-defunct [Zelle] mobile API to
  retrieve transaction history.
* [Ticketlord] (Fall 2023 -- Spring 2025): Extract [Ticketmaster]
  rotating barcode secrets from both the web and Android APIs, to
  avoid needing to use their cesspool of an unreliable mobile app for
  event access.
* [Nebulous] (Winter 2023; unfinished): Open-source [Nebula] client
  that has better support for managing downloaded videos.
* [Fuck Venmo] (Winter 2023 -- Spring 2025; archived): Software that
  fully automates the process of arguing with [Venmo]'s sociopathic
  customer support department multiple times per day so they agree to
  unlock your account that they keep locking without justification.
* [Venmo Auto Transfer Neue] (Summer 2024 -- Winter 2025): Wrapper for
  [venmo-auto-cashout] that also handles SMS OTP via my [Matrix]
  homeserver. Implementing the Matrix cryptography turned out to be
  the vast majority of the code for this project.
* [Outertube] (Fall 2024; abandoned): Open-source player for YouTube
  [WideVine L3][widevine] content streams. Based on work from
  [Decryptonite], but didn't get very far.
* [FTB Password Changer] (Summer 2024): Tool to automate the mandatory
  every-four-month password change that you have to do for
  California's [MyFTB] to avoid being permanently locked out of being
  able to pay taxes and file business documents.
* [Hotair] (Summer -- Winter 2025; unfinished): Open-source [Steam]
  client that can actually run games, including save data
  synchronization and online play. No dependencies on the proprietary
  client.
* [Blue Rover] (Fall 2026; unfinished): Automatically accept
  substitute teaching positions listed on [Red Rover] depending on
  availability.

## System administration

* radian-local (Fall 2016 -- Present, private): Personal
  configurations on top of [Radian], and other very me-specific
  infrastructure and scripts.
* [Dotman] (Summer 2017 -- Summer 2018; abandoned): A very silly idea
  I had to write a unified package manager (with [Ruby] DSL) for my
  entire system configuration (e.g. software installation,
  configuration, dotfiles, misc scripts, etc.). This was abandoned
  when I realized I could just manually write down what I did to
  configure my laptop. If you actually want declarative system
  configuration, you should probably be using [Nix].
* [wdx] (Fall 2017): Simpler and more robust alternative to [wd],
  written in [Python].
* [backup-manager] (Summer 2018 -- Spring 2025; archived):
  Orchestration tooling for personal backups, file replication, and
  monitoring, based on [Borg] and [rclone].
* [misc-scripts] (Summer 2018 -- Present): Miscellaneous utility
  scripts that I have on my shell path and might be useful to others.
* [Madeline] (Summer 2018; archived): Novel approach to directory
  syncing, used to maintain complementary mirroring of two filesystem
  trees via SSH. This idea, while interesting, never served my use
  case terribly well in the end, and the implementation is terrible. I
  now use a smaller and better-targeted personal script to serve a
  similar function.
* [Debbie] (Winter 2020 -- Winter 2025; archived): Tooling and package
  definitions for installing and managing third-party software on
  [Debian]-based distributions when not supported in the official
  repositories, similar to Arch Linux [PKGBUILD]s. Eventually, I just
  switched to Arch and maintain packages on the [AUR] where
  appropriate.
* OpsWorks deprecation (Summer 2021 -- Summer 2024, as employee of
  [Plaid], proprietary): Zero-downtime migration of several hundred
  production-critical legacy systems out of [AWS OpsWorks][opsworks]
  before its retirement.
* [apt-get-unfuck] (Summer 2022; abandoned): Tooling to record and
  rollback old package versions from [Debian]-based repositories
  without relying on online data sources. I eventually switched to
  [BTRFS] instead.
* [pass-ln] (Fall 2022): [Pass] extension for creating [symbolic
  links][symlinks].
* [Dominion Strategy server upgrade] (Winter 2023): I did a server
  upgrade for the [Dominion Strategy forum] folks from Ubuntu 10.04 to
  24.04, and documented the process. I also previously retrofitted
  proper TLS onto the old server the year prior.
* system-upgrade (Winter 2023 -- Present): Operator-present server,
  laptop, and phone upgrade manager across highly heterogeneous device
  fleet.

## Web apps and services, browser extensions

* [Ecofasten] and [Alpine Snowboards] pricing calculators (Summer
  2015, as employee at ThinkTopic, proprietary): Frontend and backend
  work on existing [Clojure]/[ClojureScript]/[Datomic] web
  applications for generating price quotes for roof-mounted solar
  panels and alpine snowboards. *Teammates: [Charles
  Gruenwald][charles], [Keren Megory-Cohen][keren].*
* [Tidier] (Spring 2019): Small application to auto-close abandoned
  GitHub issues by label and activity.
* [Hyperschedule Prime] (Summer 2017; abandoned): First attempt at an
  improved course scheduling tool for the [Claremont Colleges]. I
  didn't finish it in time for course registration.
* [Hyposchedule] (Winter 2017; archived): Small script to do personal
  course scheduling for the [Claremont Colleges].
* [Hyperschedule] (Winter 2017 -- Fall 2019): Fast and powerful course
  scheduler for the [Claremont Colleges], still used. [Frontend source
  here][hyperschedule-source], [backend source
  here][hyperschedule-api] (since replaced). *Current maintainer:
  [ASHMC](https://www.hmc.edu/ashmc/).*
* [Hyperschedule Scrapers] (Summer 2019; abandoned): Attempt to extend
  Hyperschedule to support other institutions, including the
  [University of Colorado][ucb]. This is probably still doable and
  could be a successful idea, but my priorities shifted over time.
* [whales.life] (Spring 2019, as student of [Harvey Mudd
  College][hmc], CS 121: Software Development; archived): Simple
  webapp for playing [chess] against an AI using [minimax] and [neural
  networks]. [Source here][whales.life-source]. *Teammates: [Ben
  Baral][ben], [Max Treutelaar][max], [Miles President][miles],
  [Shannon Collier][shannon].*
* [GitHub Email Backlog][geb] (Summer 2020; archived): Simple [Chrome
  extension][chrome-ext] which abuses the [GitHub notifications
  API][github-notifications] to automatically update my profile status
  with an estimate of how long you will wait for a response when you
  report an issue. This is deprecated since I have gotten my personal
  life in order and can provide a more reliable base response time.
* [Riju] (Summer 2020 -- Summer 2022): Extremely fast online
  playground for every programming language. Currently working on port
  to [Kubernetes] to improve maintainability. [Source
  here][riju-source].
* [Python in a Box][pib] (Summer 2021): Interactive online Python REPL
  in 30 lines of JavaScript. [Source here][pib-source].
* [Veidt Legacy] (Summer -- Fall 2021; abandoned): Online webcomic
  aggregator, as a web server. I decided it was insufficiently ethical
  this way and decided on a [different architecture][veidt] instead.
* [riju-k8s] (Winter 2021; abandoned): Attempt to re-write [Riju]
  based on [Kubernetes]. Has some useful infrastructure setup but no
  real progress.
* [Tinyku] (Spring 2022; abandoned): Experiment in making a simple
  replacement for Heroku after they eliminated the ability to run
  small-scale applications cheaply.
* [Veidt] (Summer 2022; abandoned): Webcomic reader and progress
  tracker, as a browser extension. I ended up using [Mihon] personally
  instead.
* [riju-neue] (Summer 2022; unfinished): Another attempt to re-write
  [Riju] based on [Kubernetes]. Also has not gotten very far.
* [Hypercast] (Winter 2022; unfinished): Free, no-hassle watch parties
  on every streaming platform. Implemented as Chrome and Firefox
  extension.
* [GNSSMS] (Summer 2023; archived): Silly Mother's Day present that
  allowed you to text a [Twilio] number and get back GPS orbit data
  from the [gnss-reflections][gnssrefl] API formerly featured on my
  [mother's website][gnss-website].
* [Radian Transfer] (Summer 2024; abandoned): Replacement for Venmo,
  abandoned when I found out that it is essentially impossible to do
  business with any money movement provider unless you already have a
  huge corporation. I still ended up writing most of the REST logic
  for account signup and login, though.
* [dontbeeviltube] (Fall 2024; unfinished): Open-source client and
  proxy for free YouTube content based on [yt-dlp], as alternative to
  [Invidious] with improved stability.
* [PhotoPrismProxy] (Fall 2025): Simple proxy webserver that allows
  more easily uploading individual photos and albums to a [PhotoPrism]
  instance.

## Writing

  Summary of strategies for solving different types of [differential
  equations], with proofs. [Source here][dess-source].

  [Harvey Mudd College][hmc], MATH 196: Independent Study - Motivation
  in Mathematics): Math worksheet trying (poorly) to show some
  applications of trigonometry to the real world.
* [pset] (Fall 2017; abandoned): Configurable templating system for
  university problem sets typeset in LaTeX. Will never be finished
  because I am no longer a college student.

  on mental health and the [paradoxical theory of change] that I
  delivered as a student panelist at a [Scripps College] student
  event.
