title: "Fiction Writing"
---

In the spring of my senior year at [Harvey Mudd
College](https://www.hmc.edu/), I took an excellent fiction writing
workshop class taught by [Prof. Sal
Plascencia](https://www.hmc.edu/hsa/faculty-staff/sal-plasencia/). The
class focused on constraint-based writing, so for each of the
assignments there were numerous rules and regulations, some of which
were individual and based on our previous work. I found it to be an
excellent experience, since I had always told myself I wanted to be
able to write fiction, but I had never actually managed to produce
anything. Over the course of the class, I created three works that I
feel confident in sharing.

**I think that *New Year's Day* is by far my best work so far.**

* [*Opportunity for Study*](/assets/OpportunityForStudy.pdf): 300
  words, does not include the letter *e*. Setting: fantasy.
* [*The Garden*](/assets/TheGarden.pdf): 1,500 words, constraints
  below. Setting: science fiction.
* [*New Year's Day*](/assets/NewYearsDay.pdf): 3,000 words,
  constraints below. Setting: real-world, historical.
