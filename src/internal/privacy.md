title: "Privacy policy"
---

If you reached this page by clicking on a link for the "privacy
policy" or "terms of service" of a product or service, then I regret
to inform you that the product or service you are looking for does not
actually exist.

Why does this page exist, you ask? In recent years it has gone into
vogue for websites to require you to register for a "developer"
account just to download your own personal data from your own user
account. It has also gone into vogue to require all "developer"
accounts to have an associated "privacy policy" and "terms of service
agreement" even when there is no product, service, or company being
developed.

So, when a website asks me for a "privacy policy" for my product or
service that does not actually exist, but makes the form field
mandatory, I put in a link to this page.
