title: "The Picard-Lindelöf Theorem"
---

This is my rendition of the proof of the existence-uniqueness theorem
for first-order differential equations, also known as the
Picard-Lindelöf theorem. I tried to be as formal and explicit as
possible while also making the proof easy to read and comprehend.

You can read the proof [here] (PDF, ~200 KB, 7 pages). For more
information about how it was created, see the [About] page.
